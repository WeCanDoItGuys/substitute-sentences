You can just print (or save to file) the phrases found by the `find_substitutes()` function in `find_substitute_sentences.py`;  
or if you want a GUI for viewing the phrases, you can use `substitute_sentences_tool.py` but you'd need to do `pip install PyQt5` first.  

Edits to optimize the speed of `find_substitutes()` are welcome! Currently if there are a lot of valid phrases (like for "what is love") it takes a while either to generate phrases or to load from the exported file.
